# TODO-EditorTool2021
 An editor tool to create to-do list in Unity to speed up progress

 ## General Info

 - Created with UIBuilder, It simply helps us to add to-do tasks, complete them, see the overall progress and search in the tasks! I am saving the data with Scriptable object so it will passed over editor sessions.
